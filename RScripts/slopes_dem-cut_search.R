# This is the function that performs the search for appropriate slope values in 
# the model for Cij as well as age-specific dementia cut-off points
#
# This function is attempting to find slopes that will create dementia incidence
# rates that match the Supplemental Table 2 in Inequalities in dementia 
# incidence between six racial and ethnic groups over 14 years 
# (Mayeda et al, 2016)

# We're starting with this US data, but may move to a different country's data
