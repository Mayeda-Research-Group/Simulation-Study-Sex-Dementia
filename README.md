**Variable Definitions**

Cij:   Cognitive function for person i at time j<br />
U:     Unmeasured/underlying variable<br />
Sij:   Survival for person i at time j<br />

**Definitions of regression parameters used to generate models for Cij**

b00:   Group mean cognitive intercept (baseline level of cognitive function) for females<br />
b01:   Effect of sex on level of cognitive function at baseline<br />
b02:   Effect of a 1-year change in baseline age (in years, centered at 50) on level of cognitive function at baseline<br />
b03:   Effect of a 1-unit change in U on level of cognitive function at baseline<br />
b10a:  Group mean cognitive slope (annual rate of cognitive change) for females aged 50-70<br />
b10b:  Group mean cognitive slope (annual rate of cognitive change) for females aged 70-85<br />
b10c:  Group mean cognitive slope (annual rate of cognitive change) for females aged 85+<br />
b11:   Effect of sex on annual rate of cognitive change<br />
b12:   Effect of a 1-year change in baseline age (in years, centered at 50) on annual rate of cognitive change<br />
b13:   Effect of a 1-unit change in U on annual rate of cognitive change<br />
